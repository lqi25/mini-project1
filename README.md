## Introduction:  
Twitter has a variety of news accounts, such as People's Daily, China, BBC News (World), and The New York Times. In these news accounts, we can easily get information from business, politics, sports and other fields around the world. Through our API, you can get the news recently,and readers'attitudes towards them. You can also classify and get keywords of the news.
