## Product Mission:
Twitter has a variety of news accounts, such as People's Daily, China, BBC News (World), and The New York Times. In these news accounts, we can easily get information from business, politics, sports and other fields around the world. The target users of our API is news readers and editors.Through our API, they can get the news recently,and readers'attitudes towards them. They can also classify and get keywords of the news.   

### User Stories:  
- I,a news reader,should be able to get news instantly.
- I,a news reader,should be able to store news from twitter in a file.
- I,a news reader,should know the category and keywords of the news.
- I,a news reader,should be able to input a news item and analyze it.
- I,a news editor,need to know whether people's attitudes towards a news item are positive or negative.
- I,a news editor,need to know people's overall attitude towards all the news obtained from twitter.   

### MVP
The minimum viable product of our project is to get the latest news from Twitter and analyze whether peopleâ€™s attitudes toward these news are positive or negative.

### User Interface Design
We use twitter api to gain the news from twitter news account,for example,the BBC News account.Then, we use google natural language api to analyze the sentiment score of each and overall news, and get people's attitude towards them.

3. Navigate to the project folder by running "
      ```
      cd WorkingTitle
      ```
      Then paste the key.json file that containing api keys in this folder and also paste the twitter api keys in the combine.py file at the appropiate places. Also need to install all the package that required.

4. In the terminal,type 
      ```
      python combine.py
      ```
      The script will get the latest 20 users. Then users need to input a keyword that they interested in.

      Then will generate a text files called TweetOutput.txt, which containing 100 tweets that include BBC news and the keyword.

## Personal learning

### Xiaoyu's part

- Building software is not easy. I always run into errors. Usually write code only require a few minutes but debug need a few hours :) so consistance is really necessary. 
- For the twitter part, there are many libraries which Twitter provided that support the standard Twitter API. I prefer TwitterSearch for its multifunction and convenience. But my filtering process of twitter messages is too simple. There is an large amount of spam and useless data, so having a more in depth filtering process would be better. 
- For the google part, the guidances and documents is more, and easy to follow. I would like to continue learning more about NLP. 
- In this project I used PYCHARM and it sometimes got stuck. Next time I may use a better compiler. And also allocated more time to realize some other goals, e.g. develop a user interface and build a database integration to store historical data. This is my first time to do API programming. Next time I will aviod coding directly without learn more about API and relative knowledge.
