## Product Mission:
Twitter has a variety of news accounts, such as People's Daily, China, BBC News (World), and The New York Times. In these news accounts, we can easily get information from business, politics, sports and other fields around the world. The target users of our API is news readers and editors.Through our API, they can get the news recently,and readers'attitudes towards them. They can also classify and get keywords of the news.   

### User Stories:  
- I,a news reader,should be able to get news instantly.
- I,a news reader,should be able to store news from twitter in a file.
- I,a news reader,should know the category and keywords of the news.
- I,a news reader,should be able to input a news item and analyze it.
- I,a news editor,need to know whether people's attitudes towards a news item are positive or negative.
- I,a news editor,need to know people's overall attitude towards all the news obtained from twitter.   

### MVP
The minimum viable product of our project is to get the latest news from Twitter and analyze whether peopleâ€™s attitudes toward these news are positive or negative.

### User Interface Design
We use twitter api to gain the news from twitter news account,for example,the BBC News account.Then, we use google natural language api to analyze the sentiment score of each and overall news, and get people's attitude towards them.
